# Habee App Landing Page

This repository contains the static landing page for **Habee**, a cheerful habitâ€‘tracking app that helps you grow good routines and stay motivated with a buzzing community. The site is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and exported as a fully static build that can be hosted on platforms like [Render](https://render.com).

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the page locally.

## Building for Production

The project is configured for static export. Create an optimized build and generate the `out` directory:

```bash
npm run build
```

Deploy the contents of the `out` folder on your static host (e.g. Render's static site service).

## License

This landing page is provided under the MIT license. Feel free to adapt it for your own Habee deployments.
